# SYNOPSIS
What can I do with this? This is a build image that contains most if not all default Alpine build tools to build custom binaries.

# BUILD
```shell
# :: Build
  FROM 11notes/alpine-build:stable as build
  RUN set -ex; \
    ... 

# :: Header
  FROM 11notes/alpine:stable
  COPY --from=build /src /dst
  ...
```

# BUILT WITH
* [alpine](https://alpinelinux.org)

# TIPS
* Allow non-root ports < 1024 via `echo "net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start={n}" > /etc/sysctl.d/ports.conf`
* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx to terminate TLS with a valid certificate
* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt certificates to protect your SSL endpoints
